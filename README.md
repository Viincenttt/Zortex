# Zortex
Zortex is a singleplayer virtual reality space-shooter game that was built in Unity. The player controls a miniature spaceship using the Oculus Touch or HTC Vive controllers. The goal of the game is to stay alive for as long as possible, while destroying as many alien spaceships as possible. The game is based on the Xortex game that is part of [The Lab](https://store.steampowered.com/app/450390/), created by Valve.

### Project features
The game is built up very modular and it can be configured to be easy or incredibly difficult. 

#### Enemy spawning configuration
The enemy spawn area has extensive configuration options. These options allow you to configure the enemy spawning area size, which enemies to spawn and how fast enemies are spawned.

#### Player vision
The player ship automatically targets and fires at enemy ships when they are in the player ship's visible area. The vision of the player ship is configurable within Unity. It uses a view angle, so targets that are far away don't require very precise aiming.

### Technologies
The game is built in Unity and uses SteamVR and the VRTK library to add support for virtual reality. All game code is written in C# and the 3D models were created using Blender. All assets in the game are self-made, except for the music and sound-effects.
